        collect just your email address when you sign up for a free account. At
        the moment we do not track you and we do not advertise to you. We do
        generate automated emails for the purpose of confirming your email or to
        facilitate password resets. We do store your login information in your

        We reserve the right to delete polls or comments for any reason. Just be
        nice! No hate speech, name-calling, copyright infringement, you know the
        drill. While this site is under development, the permanence of your
        polls, votes, and comments is not guaranteed. Maybe someday this site
        will grow up to be a real destination. Until then, have fun, and thanks
        for stopping by!
