      <p>
        This website is still under development, and for now is offered with no
        warranties or guarantees of the safety of your data. In the meantime, we
        collect just your email address when you sign up for a free account. At
        the moment we do not track you and we do not advertise to you. We do not
        do anything with that email address, except to confirm it exists via
        automated email message. We also email that address if you request a
        password reset. We do store your login information in your browser's
        local storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to delete polls or comments for any reason. Just be
        nice! No hate speech, name-calling, copyright infringement, you know the
        drill. So long as this site remains a project and not a product, your
        data may disappear at any moment. Though we hope not!
      </p>
      <p>
        When the day comes that this does turn into a product, or we do start to
        use analytics or advertise or offer features for a fee, we will precede
        that with new terms of service. Until then, however, have fun, enjoy
        what we are building.
